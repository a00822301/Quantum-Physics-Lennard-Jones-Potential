# Lennard-Jones-Potential
The main objective of this project is to calculate the energy spectrum of the
Mg2 molecule. In particular, it is necessary to find the energy values E that
satisfy the nonlinear equation f (E) = 0 [see Eq. (18) of the Am. J. Phys. 74,
572 (2006); doi: 10.1119/1.2192788]],

# Spherical Potential Well
This project consists obtaining the eigenvalues of the 3D spherical well along
with the eigenfunctions composed of the spherical harmonics and the spherical
bessel functions.

I am the sole writer of the codes, nevertheless I collaborated with friends to
solve questions and write the final report.
