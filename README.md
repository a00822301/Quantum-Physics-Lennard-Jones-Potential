The main objective of this project is to calculate the energy spectrum of the Mg2 molecule. In particular, it is necessary to find the energy values E that satisfy the nonlinear equation f (E) = 0 [see Eq. (18) of the Am. J. Phys. 74, 572 (2006); doi: 10.1119/1.2192788]], 
I am the sole writer of the codes, nevertheless I collaborated with friends to solve questions and write the final report.
